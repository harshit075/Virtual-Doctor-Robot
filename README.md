This project proposes the development of an IoT-based Virtual Doctor Robot designed to function 
as a hospital assistant. The robot is equipped with a variety of health monitoring sensors to collect 
patient data, facilitate video calls between patients and doctors, and maintain a comprehensive 
database of patient health information. The system comprises both hardware and software 
components. The hardware includes the robot itself, equipped with sensors and communication 
devices. The software component features a web application that allows hospitals to rent or 
purchase the robot, manage patient data, and facilitate video consultations. This integrated 
approach is intended to alleviate the workload of hospital staff, ensure timely health data 
collection, and improve patient-doctor communication.
